Tips to improve Performance:
1. Avoid * in the selects
2. Avoid using more memory consumed data types.
3.Avoid Using Order by or group by clause.
4. Try to filter the data at the begining itself but not at the bottom of the query.
5. Create Indexes( cluster and non-clustered index)
6. Keep Cluster index on a appropiate coulmns.
7. mostly used columns should be in non-clustered key.
8. Drop unused Indexes.
9. Good to create Indexes on values(int) then character(char\varchar)
10. Use the key tablockX while inserting.
11. Use with (nolock) while data retrive.
12. Use nocount on in reducing the Execution Time and resource consumption.
13. Use Try and catch block in sp to avoid failures of the sp.
14. Avoid Cursors as it is line by line execution take the sql performance down. Use it sensability.
